# AWS Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual AWS project values

VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your-user-pool-id
# AWS Cognito Client ID - Critical for authentication flows (sign up, sign in, password recovery)
# Get this from AWS Console > Cognito > User Pools > Your Pool > App clients (usually 26 characters)
# Run 'npm run setup:cognito' to create and get this value automatically
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_AWS_DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=donezo-app
VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key

# Important Notes:
# - All variables must start with VITE_ for Vite to include them in the build
# - For production, use IAM roles instead of access keys
# - These credentials should have DynamoDB and Cognito permissions
# - Restart your dev server after changing these values
