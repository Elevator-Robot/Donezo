## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- An AWS account (free tier sufficient)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Doink
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up AWS (required for user accounts):
   - Follow the detailed guide in [AWS_SETUP.md](AWS_SETUP.md)
   - Create your AWS DynamoDB table and Cognito User Pool
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your AWS credentials

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Environment Variables for Production:**
Make sure your production environment has the AWS credentials:
```env
VITE_AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your-user-pool-id
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_AWS_DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=your-table-name
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical:** The `VITE_AWS_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` is required for all authentication flows (sign up, sign in, password recovery). If this is missing or incorrect, authentication will fail with configuration errors. See troubleshooting in [AWS_SETUP.md](AWS_SETUP.md).

See [AWS_SETUP.md](AWS_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.
